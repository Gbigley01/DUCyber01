**IMPORTANT:** For the next unit, Windows, you and students will be using a new Windows lab environment. You will receive a registration link that you and your students can use. 

If this is the first time you and students are using Azure in the program, refer to the instructions in Lesson 6.3 on how to demonstrate set-up to students and distribute credentials to them afterwards.
