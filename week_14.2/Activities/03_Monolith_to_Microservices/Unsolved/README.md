## Activity File: Monolithic Architectures And Issues

In this activity, you will play the role of a systems engineer.

- Your company has a web store app that is becoming popular. 

- The store must switch to architecture so it can be more redundant and scalable. You've decided to make the transition from traditional monolith to microservices.

- You have to design a microservices setup based on the current monolithic web store app diagram.

### Instructions

1. Review the current monolithic web store app diagram:

    ![current monolithic web store app diagram](../../../Images/Activity_1_Unsolved.png)

    - **Note:** It is not important that you know exactly what each microservice does. It _is_ important that you know _why_ we are separating them: We are separating them because having separate components means that each serves a single function, allowing for repeatable and scalable infrastructure.

2. Using your browser, go to the site [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

3. Select **Open Existing Diagram** and select the activity file: `activity_one_unsolved.drawio`. 
    - Your instructor should have sent an additional file called: `activity_one_unsolved.drawio` 


4. Edit the diagram. As components are removed from the main rectangle, crete a new rectangle to surround each individual component and label accordingly. 

    - When you add a rectangle, right-click it and select "To Back" to give the appearance that that box is behind the component. 

5. Using a rectangle, indicate each of the following servers\:

    - A store app server
    - A user server 
    - An authentication server 

6. In addition, split the monolithic database itself into three distinct components:

    - One database to handle all user information from the store app, such as preferences and sessions.
    - One database to store credential information that the authentication server checks against.
    - One inventory database that is updated when a user buys something from the store.

7. Connect each new database to its corresponding server.

#### Bonus

Your Customer Service department has been receiving complaints that the company's ecommerce store regularly times out when customers are trying to access it. This is a sign that the store app is unable to process all the requests.

- Revamp your setup to include a load balancer and two identical versions of the store app.

**Note:** Remember to show the basic information flows between the microservices.
