## Activity File: Move and Create Directories

In this activity, you will work as a junior sysadmin tasked with vetting a process to create Windows event logs. 

These logs will later be integrated into a log management program known as a SIEMS. 

- Please use your **Windows 10 virtual machine** for this activity. 

### Instructions: 

- Because we will eventually decommission the `Alex` user, move the `contracts` folder from Alex's desktop directory to `C:\`.

- Create `Logs` and `Scripts` directories in `C:\`.

- Check the contents of the `C:\` directory to make sure the `Logs` and `Scripts` directories exist.

**Bonus**

- Use `Rename-Item` to capitalize the `contracts` directory if it is not already.
