## Solutions Guide: Task Scheduling

- Press the `Windows` key and open Task Scheduler.

- Create a new task by selecting `Create Task...` on the right `Actions` window.
  
  - Note: If you don't see the `Actions` sub-window on the right, go to `View`, `Customize`, and make sure `Action Pane` is enabled.

- In the `Create Task` GUI window, navigate to the `Triggers` tab, and click `New...`.

- Set `Begin the task` to `On a schedule`.

- Make sure our task is set to repeat `Daily` with `Recur every:[x] day` set to `1`, and `Start:` date set to today. It should already be set, but you may have to input it manually.

- Finally, set the time to be a minute or two after the current time.

- Hit `OK` to save your changes and return to the `Create Task` window.
