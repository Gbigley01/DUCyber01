From the Sguil console, right-click on the Alert ID and pivot to Transcript, then scroll to the bottom of the Transcript window.

3. What is the message in the HTML body?

    - `hi!`

Close the Transcript window and go back to the Snort rule window. Click on the research.zscaler.com URL. A web browser will launch and take you to the Zscaler website. Read through the article and then answer the remaining questions.
