## Activity File: Uploading Data into Splunk Activity

- As the recently hired SOC manager at OMP, your first task after setting up Splunk is to upload data into your Splunk repository. 

- You have been provided several log files to upload, which will later be used to detect security events.

### Instructions

1. Open the provided log files.

2. Use the Splunk data upload feature to load the log files.

3. Give each file the same name as the log file.
   - No description is required.
  
4. Provide a brief summary about what each log file contains as well as what they monitor for.

    - **Hint:** Use Google to help with your research.
